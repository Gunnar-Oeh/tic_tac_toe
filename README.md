# Coding Challenge - Tic-Tac-Toe

Today we're going to test and improve our coding skills by creating a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python. The challenge was started to teach us the use of pseudocode and coordinated team-work.

## Environment

Fork this repository, clone it on your machine and create a new environment inside the folder. Don't forget to activate it for the assignment. 
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Task

Write your own Tic-Tac-Toe game. The assignment file contains a description on how the game should work. It may also help you to create a good structure for your code. 

## Minimal coding practices to keep in mind!

- Functions should have explicit names.
- Functions should have docstrings explaining how to call them
- Functions should be between 4-10 lines of code long
